Research Project Compile Bot

Purpose:
        
    NetCDF4 data cannot be manipulated using chromebooks. Chrome OS is unsupportive of the file type(and corrupts it) and Chromebook hardware is generally lacking as data mining hardware.
    
    This bot if the solution, allowing me to compile code in a different runtime environment on my home PC, as well as return the traceback on any errors and the ouput via email.
