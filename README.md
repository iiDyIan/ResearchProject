Working paper title:
On The Correlation of Rogue Wave Occurrence And Sea State Parameters Utilizing Field Data

Core research question:
Is the Pearson coefficient, spearman coefficient, or covariance of any sea-state parameters relative to the occurrence of rogue waves of significant value to prove or disprove correlation between the sea-state and occurence of Rogue Waves?

Data Availability Statement:
All field data utilized is publicly available here, and on completion of the project, the data utilized at that date will be released.

Significane statement:
The significance of this research cannot be understated despite its somewhat small scope. Given a correlation between any variables pertaining to the description of waves and the outcome of those waves(and their given rogue classification) could entail prediction and forecasting methods for the occurence of Rogue Waves.
